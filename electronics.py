resistors = {
    "name" : "Resistor",
    "info" : "Resistors are electrical components in an electric circuit that slow down current in the circuit. They deliberately lose energy in the form of heat or thermal energy. Appliances such as electric heaters, electric ovens, and toasters all use resistors to turn current into heat, then using the heat lost from this resistor to warm the surrounding area. Even the filament from an incandescent light bulb is effectively a resistor, slowing down the current and heating up a wire to a high enough temperature that it gives off light. This light given off is known as blackbody radiation. Resistors also have applications in electrical devices like computers and cell phones to damp out unwanted electrical signals. It's counter-intuitive, but even though energy is dissipated with resistance, resistors are absolutely essential to the proper functioning of electronics. They function to ensure that other components aren't provided with too much voltage or electric current. Resistors have a resistance from a few Ohms (立) to several Megaohms (M立 = million Ohms). For more detailed information on resistors please see hyperphysics. An explanation of the colour code seen in figure 1 can be found here."

capacitors = {
    "name" : "Capacitor",
    "info" : "A capacitor is an electronic device that stores charge and energy. Capacitors can give off energy much faster than batteries can, resulting in much higher power density than batteries with the same amount of energy. Research into capacitors is ongoing to see if they can be used for storage of electrical energy for the electrical grid. While capacitors are old technology, supercapacitors are a new twist on this technology. Capacitors are simply devices that consist of two conductors carrying equal but opposite charges. A simple parallel-plate capacitor consists of two equally-sized metal plates, known as electrodes, separated by an insulator, known as a dielectric, held parallel to each other. The capacitor is then integrated into an electric circuit. In a simple direct current circuit, each plate of the capacitor becomes oppositely charged over time due to the path of the electric current through the circuit. The battery drives charge in one direction such that one plate becomes positively charged and the other becomes negatively charged. This creates an electric field due to the buildup of equal and opposite charges, resulting in a potential difference, or voltage between the plates. Since the capacitance of the plates is constant, the voltage between the plates increases proportionally. As the charge on each plate increases, the voltage between the plates equals the voltage of the battery, at which point current will no longer flow through the circuit.[2] This charging and discharging effect can be seen in Figure 2. Current can resume flowing if an alternate path is opened so that the capacitors can discharge itself or by using an alternating current so that the capacitor is periodically charged and discharged."

Modern incandescent light bulbs (see Figure 1) are highly inefficient, with about 90% of the energy supplied to them being lost as heat.[2] This inefficiency sparked a need for a variety of more efficient electrical lights, which spawned several alternatives to the traditional incandescent light bulb. These include:- LED light bulbs:- CFL light bulbs:- Halogen lights"

diodes = {
    "name" : "Diode",
    "info" : "A diode is an electrical component with the fundamental property of only allowing electric current to flow in one direction through it. This property is essential to the conversion of alternating current into direct current, which is why diodes are commonly found in AC adapters and other rectifier circuits. The most common type of diode nowadays is the semiconductor diode (see Figure 1). Additionally, diodes can give off light, and these are called light emitting diodes, or LEDs. Commercial LED light bulbs have been available since the 1960s, but technical developments and improvements in the 1990s and 2000s greatly boosted their popularity.[4][5] This product helps reduce energy consumption, and avoids the mercury contamination of compact florescent bulbs. Another key advantage is that LEDs almost never burn out the way traditional light bulbs do. The physics of these diodes are quite closely related to photovoltaic cells. LEDs take electricity and make light, while photovoltaic cells take light and make electricity."
